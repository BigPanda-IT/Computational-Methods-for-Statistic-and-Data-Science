## Initial conditions:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x + b^T x,
\]

where \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) is symmetric and \( b \in \mathbb{R}^n \)

## To find:

\( \nabla_x f(x) \) and \( \nabla^2 f(x) \)

## Solution:

1) At the beginning, need to find the gradient:

Take into account that A is symmetric, that is, \( A = A^T \).

\[
\nabla_x (x^T A x) = (A + A^T)x
\]

So:

\[
\nabla_x \left( \frac{1}{2} x^T A x \right) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_x (x^T A x) = \frac{1}{2} (A + A) x = Ax
\]

\[
\nabla_x (b^T x) = b.
\]

So, at the finally:


\[
\nabla_x f(x) = Ax + b.
\]


2) At the beginning, need to find the Hessian:

Need to differentiate the gradient \( \nabla_x f(x) = Ax + b \) with respect to \( x \), because the Hessian is the matrix of second derivatives.

So, 
\[
\nabla^2 (Ax) = A.
\]

\[
\nabla^2 b = 0.
\]

b - const, and A - coefficient, constant before x

Solution:

\[
\nabla_x f(x) = Ax + b
\]

\[
\nabla^2 f(x) = A

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
